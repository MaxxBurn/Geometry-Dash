This is my first ever coded game on Godot game engine, it was surprisingly a really pleaseant project, I had a lot of fun coding it
and also learned a lot of new stuff such as:

<b>Collision
Sprites
Usage of vectors in game deving
Debugging
Finding how people can bug the game and how that affects the game
Level design / Level theme
Challenging the player via map patterns
</b>

This was overall a really nice experience, and more than anything i enjoyed talking to the Godot community in Discord, they were really helpful and provided links whenever needed. Also absolutely love the documentation of the game engine
